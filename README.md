	Undead herds/packs
	Triggerable pawn explosions (for the bloater) (Low priority)
	Acidic explosion (Spawns puddles of acid or slime filth and causes acid damage on those within the blast)
	Creature can spawn other creatures (Similar to mech queen. Requires fuel and such. Basically just a more useful version of the mech queen one) (For the Wraith)

	Targetable lure ability (for will-o-wisps) Should require line of sight. Basically the beckon psycast
	Condition for some undead so they can be harmed or debuffed by sunlight, similar to sunlight sensitivity gene
	Ability for an AoE blast that harms the hearing organs of and stuns nearby creatures (But not the user) (low priority)
	Make it so that the undead can heal, albeit quite slowly. (Thus ancouraging the player to heal/repair them)
	Ability an ability for the Blight Dragon so it can spew acid. Make it triggerable via a gizmo if possible (for tamed ones)
	
	Damage and Hediff that only affects the undead. (For use with the anti-undead faction items and such)
	Damage and Hediff that only affects the living. (For use with the more evil items and such)
	Add UI Tab for the undead (and make sure they don't show up in the mechs tab)
	Make it so players can name their undead minions
	Add an xml-usable way to have certain pawns give a thoughtdef to those around them, such as the fused legion striking fear into enemies
