	Acidic explosion (Spawns puddles of acid or slime filth and causes acid damage on those within the blast)
	Creature can spawn other creatures (Similar to mech queen)
	Slam attack AoE (triggerable) (Can we make it not harm the pawn doing the AoE?)

	Condition for some undead so they can be harmed or debuffed by sunlight
	Ability for an AoE blast that harms the hearing organs of and stuns nearby creatures (But not the user) (low priority)
	
	Hediff that only affects the undead. (For use with the anti-undead faction items and such)
